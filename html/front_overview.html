It can also define if a group should be a room or a group.

<p>The metadata for the group is only stored in the app if theres no other place to store it. For example, in the case of a Hue Bridge, it can store both groups and rooms, so this page sends messages to bridge. This allows multiple versions of the app to use the same data without explicitly syncing the app's save data.  </p>

<td><h2>Palette Page</h2>
<p>The Palete provides a way for the user to set more than one color at a time, either across multiple lights, or on a single light that supports individually accessible RGB LEDs. Hues would be the classic example of a light that can only support one color, while an arduino light strip is a good example of a light that can supoprt multiple colors. </p><dl class="section copyright"><dt>Copyright</dt><dd>Copyright (C) 2015 - 2020. Released under the GNU General Public License.</dd></dl>
<p>The page is split up into two sub-pages. One page is a <a class="el" href="class_multi_color_picker.html" title="The MultiColorPicker class is a color picker designed for choosing multiple colors at once...">MultiColorPicker</a>, which allows the user to drag up to six selected colors around, or to alternatively choose a relationship of colors (IE, complementary or triad) and change all the colors at once. There also exists a <a class="el" href="class_palette_scroll_area.html" title="The PaletteScrollArea class is a QScrollArea that contains a series of buttons that can be used to si...">PaletteScrollArea</a>, which allows the user to choose a predefined set of colors, such as "Fire" (reds, oranges yellows), "Water" (blues, teals, purples), or "Poison"(purples, greys).</p>
<p class="endtd">There also exists a <a class="el" href="class_routine_buttons_widget.html" title="The RoutineButtonsWidget class is a basic widget that holds a grid of lightsbuttons that each map to ...">RoutineButtonsWidget</a> that is not part of this page, but is accessible through a menu when this page is open if a light supports individually addressable LEDs. This page can be used to change the type of routine that is being used to display the colors. For instance, the "Multi Glimmer" uses one color as a base, and randomly sets a small subset of lights to other colors. "Multi Random Solid" sets all LEDs to the same color, and then on each update, it chooses a color from the palette, and sets all lights to that color.  </p>

Released under the GNU General Public License.</dd></dl>
<p>Moods can be thought of as a recipe for lights. They have a list of lights and exact states for those lights, as well as a set of "default states" for groups and rooms. Default states have less priority than light states, so if a light is part of a group and is already defined as having a state, the individual light state definition will override the group's defintion.  </p>

Released under the GNU General Public License.</dd></dl>
<p>The first set of options relate to connected lights and allow the user to choose to add new connections, or delete data on existing lights. The next set of options relate to the app's save data and can be used to archive the current data or load data from a different version of the app. Due to restrictions caused by discovery methods and license agreements, discovery data is never saved in archivable data. However, groups, rooms, and moods are always saved and can be shared among multiple instances of the app. The next set of pages are pages like a Copyright page, which give necessary copyright info.</p>
<p class="endtd">At the bottom of the settings page is the <a class="el" href="class_global_settings_widget.html" title="The GlobalSettingsWidget class is a widget for the settings page that contains all the advanced setti...">GlobalSettingsWidget</a>, which allows the user to set some unique app settings. For instance, it currently supports turning on and off specific types of hardware, and turning on and off a timeout.  </p>
