## <a name="mobile-support">Mobile Builds</a>

The GUI makes use of Qt5's support for Android and iOS.

The mobile version of Corluma supports all communication protocols the desktop version supports except serial communication. 

The screen orientation for mobile devices will support portrait and landscape for tablets with an aspect 
ratio of 4:3, such as an iPad. For phones and thinner tablets, only portrait will be supported.

There are a couple of known issues with our current mobile support:

* In Qt versions before iOS 5.5.2, there is a compatibility issue with Apple's bitcode setting. 
To get around this, either install a more recent version of Qt, or go into the Xcodeproj generated by 
Qt Creator and change the enable bitcode setting to off. For more information, [check here](http://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/interest/2015-October/019393.html). 
* Android 7.0 has compatibility issues with QSslSocket, due to dropping support for openssl in favor boringssl. Either recompile Qt from source to not support SSL, or compile your own version of libssl.so and libcrypto.so. To do the latter, check the [Qt Documentation](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/opensslsupport.html).
