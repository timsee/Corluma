# Corluma

Corluma is a cross-platform GUI designed to control Phillips Hue lights, Corsair RGB Keyboards, and arduino sketches from the [RGB-LED-Routines project](https://github.com/timsee/RGB-LED-Routines). It supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, and iOS. It requires on Qt5.2 or later and C++11.

## <a name="mobile-support">Mobile Builds</a>

The GUI makes use of Qt5's support for Android and iOS. To use it, set up your Qt Development environment
to work with either android or iOS, attach the device, and build to that target. You may need to update
your user specific settings in Qt in order to recognize the new targets.

The mobile application can currently use HTTP and UDP samples from RGB-LED-Routines. It can also communicate with Phillips Hues. It cannot be used with the serial samples, since mobile phones aren't designed to interface
with serial ports. 

RGB Keyboard support is not currently implemented on any platform.

The screen orientation for mobile devices will support portrait and landscape for tablets with an aspect 
ratio of 4:3, such as an iPad. For phones and thinner tablets, only portrait will be supported.

There are a couple of known issues with our current mobile support:

* In Qt versions before iOS 5.5.2, there is a compatibility issue with Apple's bitcode setting. 
To get around this, either install a more recent version of Qt, or go into the Xcodeproj generated by 
Qt Creator and change the enable bitcode setting to off. For more information, [check here](http://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/interest/2015-October/019393.html). 
* Android 7.0 has compatibility issues with QSslSocket. Theres no truly elegant way around this. Either recompile Qt from source to not support SSL, or package your own version of libssl and libcrypto. The former takes a long time, the latter is not reccommended by android for product releases but is fine for debugging.
