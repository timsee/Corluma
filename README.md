# Corluma

Corluma is a cross-platform GUI designed to control Phillips Hue lights, Corsair RGB Keyboards, and arduino sketches from the [RGB-LED-Routines project](https://github.com/timsee/RGB-LED-Routines). It supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, and iOS. It requires on Qt5.2 or later and C++11.

The GUI makes use of Qt5's support for Android and iOS.

The mobile application can also control Phillips Hues and can control HTTP and UDP samples from [RGB-LED-Routine](https://github.com/timsee/Corluma). It cannot be used with the serial samples, since mobile phones aren't designed to interface
with serial ports. 

The screen orientation for mobile devices will support portrait and landscape for tablets with an aspect 
ratio of 4:3, such as an iPad. For phones and thinner tablets, only portrait will be supported.

There are a couple of known issues with our current mobile support:

* In Qt versions before iOS 5.5.2, there is a compatibility issue with Apple's bitcode setting. 
To get around this, either install a more recent version of Qt, or go into the Xcodeproj generated by 
Qt Creator and change the enable bitcode setting to off. For more information, [check here](http://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/interest/2015-October/019393.html). 
* Android 7.0 has compatibility issues with QSslSocket, due to dropping support for openssl in favor boringssl. Either recompile Qt from source to not support SSL, or compile your own version of libssl.so and libcrypto.so. To do the latter, check the [Qt Documentation](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/opensslsupport.html).
