 * \brief The LightsButton class provides all of the buttons used within the application.
 *        All buttons have an icon, while some have labels or extra logic attached.
 *
 * There are currently three different ways you can set up a button. A standard button
 * emits a EColorGroup and a ELightingRoutine and doesn't have a label. A labeled button
 * emits a EColorGroup and a ELightingRoutine, and it also has a label at the bottom of
 * the button. A menu button emits a page number, and is used by the main menu.
